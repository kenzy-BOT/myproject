         <h2>What are the solutions to climate change?</h2>
         <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspClimate change is happening now, and it’s the most serious threat to life on our planet. Luckily, there are plenty of solutions to climate change and they are well-understood </p>
         <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn 2015, world leaders signed a major treaty called the Paris agreement to put these solutions into practice.
 
             Core to all climate change solutions is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which must get to zero as soon as possible.
             
             Because both forests and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing the natural ability of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming.</p>

        <h3> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:</h3>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Keep fossil fuels in the ground</b>. Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Invest in renewable energy.</b>Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Switch to sustainable transport.</b>Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Help us keep our homes cosy.</b> Homes shouldn’t be draughty and cold – it’s a waste of money, and miserable in the winter. The government can help households heat our homes in a green way – such as by insulating walls and roofs and switching away from oil or gas boilers to heat pumps.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Improve farming and encourage vegan diets.</b>One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan. Businesses and food retailers can improve farming practices and provide more plant-based products to help people make the shift.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Restore nature to absorb more carbon.</b> The natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions, but we need to look after it. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through ‘rewilding’ schemes is a good place to start. This is because photosynthesising plants draw down carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it away in soils.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Protect forests like the Amazon. </b>Forests are crucial in the fight against climate change, and protecting them is an important climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial scale destroys giant trees which could be sucking up huge amounts of carbon. Yet companies destroy forests to make way for animal farming, soya or palm oil plantations. Governments can stop them by making better laws.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Protect the oceans</b> Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to keep our climate stable. But many are overfished, used for oil and gas drilling or threatened by deep sea mining. Protecting oceans and the life in them is ultimately a way to protect ourselves from climate change.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Reduce how much people consume.</b> Our transport, fashion, food and other lifestyle choices all have different impacts on the climate. This is often by design – fashion and technology companies, for example, will release far more products than are realistically needed. But while reducing consumption of these products might be hard, it’s most certainly worth it. Reducing overall consumption in more wealthy countries can help put less strain on the planet.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>-Reduce plastic.</b>Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050 (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, and to feel that climate change is too big to solve. But we already have the answers, now it’s a question of making them happen. To work, all of these solutions need strong international cooperation between governments and businesses, including the most polluting sectors.</p>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Individuals can also play a part by making better choices about where they get their energy, how they travel, and what food they eat. But the best way for anyone to help stop climate change is to take collective action. This means pressuring governments and corporations to change their policies and business practices.</P>
         <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Governments want to be re-elected. And businesses can’t survive without customers. Demanding action from them is a powerful way to make change happen.</P>

         <h2>Three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
            <P>As a nation, we are generating more garbage. We don’t know what to do with it.  Irresponsible disposal of this waste is polluting the environment and poses a public health risk. Present disposal methods threaten our health, safety, and environment, and pose additional indirect costs to society. Most industrial, commercial, and household waste is now disposing of in landfills or surface impoundments. Waste treated in this manner is contaminating groundwater, rivers, and streams. Burning of waste releases hazardous gases into the air. The solution to this problem is in the “ Three Rs ” approach—reduce, reuse, recycle.</P>
            <h3>Reduce</h3>
            <p>Reducing the amount you buy is the most important of all the options to manage waste. Composting is a common technique to reduce the volume of kitchen waste to ‘zero waste.’ It is also an effective method through which kitchen waste can be recycled back into nature. The basic is to only purchase goods that we need and in the right amount.</p>
            <p><b>Among the main steps consumers can fallow to reduce waste are:</b></p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp1-Choosing items that you need, not want</p>
            <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2-Shopping for high-quality items</P>
                <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3-Using minimum packaging</P>
                    <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp4-Buying local products</P>
            <h3>Reuse</h3>
            <p>There are definite items in our garbage that can be reused. Reusing waste items means that instead of dumping them, we can reuse these items.</p>
            <p><b>The following are some examples of reuse:</b></p>
            <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp1- Items such as plastic containers and pickle bottles should be reused to store other things.</P>
                <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2- We can also reuse cardboard boxes, wrapping papers, and chocolate boxes.</P>
                    <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3- We can give away old clothes to the needy people.</P>
                        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp4- It is better to use cloth bags in place of plastic bags for shopping.</P>
                            <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp5- Buy such products which can be reused such as rechargeable batteries</P>
                            <h3>Recycle</h3>
                            <p>Often you may find persons (the Kabariwalas) who visit our home, and to whom we sell old newspapers, bottles, tins, magazines, etc. perhaps you have never thought where these products go. These products are used as raw materials for manufacturing other items</p>
                            <p>In other words, recycling takes place in the manufacturing of these products. This is an important effort, as in this process, we not only reduce the load of garbage as well as conserve natural resources also.</p>
                            <p>Recycling of some common items such as glass, metals, paper, plastics, cardboard, batteries, cans made of steel and aluminum, rubber, wooden furniture easily possible.</p>
                            <p>So, discarding your waste, find ways to recycle it besides letting it go to landfills.</p>
        <p><b>Main Recycling Collection Methods:</b></p>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp1- The curbside collection needs homeowners to discrete recyclables from their garbage. Clean recyclables may require to be placed in special containers. While the garbage goes in standard containers. Both are retained at the curb for collection by separate trucks.</P>
            <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2-Drop-off centers are one of the simplest methods of collecting recyclable materials. People can drop off their used glass, paper metal, and plastic at a selected recycling drop-off site.</P>
                <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3- Buyback centers purchase aluminum and other, plastic, newsprint, metals, glass, and sometimes batteries and other materials.</P>
