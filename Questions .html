         <h2>General questions</h2>
         <h3>What’s the difference between climate change and global warming?</h3>
        <p>“Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.</p>
        <h3>What’s the difference between weather and climate?</h3>
        <p>“Weather” refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours, to days to weeks. Examples are familiar – rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, sleet, and hail.</p>
        <p>“Climate” refers to longer-term averages (which may be regional or global) and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several decades. detailed answer </P>
        <h3>Is it too late to prevent climate change?</h3>
        <p>Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries.</p>
       <h2>Climate data</h2>
       <h3>What types of data do scientists use to study climate?</h3>
       <p>Climate researchers employ a wide range of direct and indirect measurements to thoroughly investigate Earth's climate history. These measurements include data from natural sources like tree rings, ice cores, corals, and sediments from oceans and lakes. Additionally, data from satellites in space, instruments on the International Space Station, aircraft, ships, buoys, and ground-based instruments are all vital for this research. This comprehensive array of data sources allows scientists to gain a detailed understanding of Earth's climate history.</p>
       <h3>How do scientists measure global temperature?</h3>
       <p>Modern weather observations primarily originate from a network of sources, including weather stations, weather balloons, radar systems, ships, buoys, and satellites.</p>
            <h2>Greenhouse gases</h2>
           <h3>What is the greenhouse effect?</h3>
           <p>The greenhouse effect is the process through which heat is trapped near Earth's surface by substances known as 'greenhouse gases.' Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.</p>
       <h3>How might Earth’s atmosphere, land, and ocean systems respond to changes in carbon dioxide over time?</h3>
       <p>The amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed by Earth's life forms, ocean, and other "sinks" might decrease as time goes by. Natural carbon sinks (the carbon absorbers, as opposed to "sources," which release carbon) on land and in the ocean have become less effective over time. That is, natural sinks that removed about 60% of annual human-caused CO2 emissions in 1959 now remove about 55% today.</p>
       <h2>Global temperatures (land and ocean)</h2>
       <h3>Has Earth continued to warm since 1998?</h3>
       <p>Yes, evidence shows warming from 1998 to the present, with 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 being the hottest years globally since 1880.</p>
       <h3>Is the ocean continuing to warm?</h3>
       <p>​Yes, the ocean is continuing to warm. Notably, all ocean basins have been experiencing significant warming since 1998, with more heat being transferred deeper into the ocean since 1990.</p>
      <h2>Ice and snow</h2>
       <h3>How is Earth’s sea ice faring in our warming world?</h3>
       <p>Arctic sea ice volume and extent have been declining since record-keeping began in the late 1970s and prior. Antarctic sea ice extent is currently below the long-term average of prior decades since 1979.</p>
       <h2>The sun, volcanoes, and more</h2>
       <h3>Is the Sun causing global warming?</h3>
       <p>No. The Sun can influence Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen in recent decades.</p>
       <h3>What do volcanoes have to do with climate change?</h3>
       <p>Volcanic eruptions are often discussed in the context of climate change because they release CO2 and other gases into our atmosphere. However, the impact of human activities on the carbon cycle far exceeds that of all the world's volcanoes combined, by more than 100 times.

        To put it in perspective, while volcanic eruptions do contribute to an increase in atmospheric CO2, human activities release an amount of CO2 equivalent to what a Mount St. Helens-sized eruption produces every 2.5 hours and a Mount Pinatubo-sized eruption twice daily. </p>
        <h3>Is the ozone hole causing climate change?</h3>
        <p>Yes and no. The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation.</p>
       <h2>Past climates</h2>
       <h3>How do we know what greenhouse gas and temperature levels were in the distant past?</h3>
       <p>Ice cores are scientists’ best source for historical climate data. Other tools for learning about Earth’s ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep a rough record of each growing season’s temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000 years. Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical ocean. Other proxies, such as benthic cores, extend our knowledge of past climate back about a billion years.</p>
