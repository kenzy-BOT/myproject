         <h2>Climate Change</h2>
         <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspClimate change, periodic modification of Earth’s climate brought about as a result of changes in the atmosphere as well as interactions between the atmosphere and various other geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors within the Earth system.</p>
         <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion. Both its physical properties and its rate and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, the geographic position of continents, ocean currents, the location and orientation of mountain ranges, atmospheric chemistry, and vegetation growing on the land surface. All these factors change through time. Some factors, such as the distribution of heat within the oceans, atmospheric chemistry, and surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such as the position of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges, change over very long timescales. Therefore, climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of the atmosphere, varies at every conceivable timescale.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspClimate is often defined loosely as the average weather at a particular place, incorporating such features as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and windiness. A more specific definition would state that climate is the mean state and variability of these features over some extended time period. Both definitions acknowledge that the weather is always changing, owing to instabilities in the atmosphere. And as weather varies from day to day, so too does climate vary, from daily day-and-night cycles up to periods of geologic time hundreds of millions of years long. In a very real sense, climate variation is a redundant expression—climate is always varying. No two years are exactly alike, nor are any two decades, any two centuries, or any two millennia.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis article addresses the concept of climatic variation and change within the set of integrated natural features and processes known as the Earth system. The nature of the evidence for climate change is explained, as are the principal mechanisms that have caused climate change throughout the history of Earth. Finally, a detailed description is given of climate change over many different timescales, ranging from a typical human life span to all of geologic time. For a detailed description of the development of Earth’s atmosphere, see the article atmosphere, evolution of. For full treatment of the most critical issue of climate change in the contemporary world, see global warming. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</p>
        <h3><I>The Earth system</I></h3>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of Earth, including oceans, ice masses (glaciers and sea ice), land surfaces, and vegetation. Together, they make up an integrated Earth system, in which all components interact with and influence one another in often complex ways. For instance, climate influences the distribution of vegetation on Earth’s surface (e.g., deserts exist in arid regions, forests in humid regions), but vegetation in turn influences climate by reflecting radiant energy back into the atmosphere, transferring water (and latent heat) from soil to the atmosphere, and influencing the horizontal movement of air across the land surface.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEarth scientists and atmospheric scientists are still seeking a full understanding of the complex feedbacks and interactions among the various components of the Earth system. This effort is being facilitated by the development of an interdisciplinary science called Earth system science. Earth system science is composed of a wide range of disciplines, including climatology (the study of the atmosphere), geology (the study of Earth’s surface and underground processes), ecology (the study of how Earth’s organisms relate to one another and their environment), oceanography (the study of Earth’s oceans), glaciology (the study of Earth’s ice masses), and even the social sciences (the study of human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects).</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA full understanding of the Earth system requires knowledge of how the system and its components have changed through time. The pursuit of this understanding has led to development of Earth system history, an interdisciplinary science that includes not only the contributions of Earth system scientists but also paleontologists (who study the life of past geologic periods), paleoclimatologists (who study past climates), paleoecologists (who study past environments and ecosystems), paleoceanographers (who study the history of the oceans), and other scientists concerned with Earth history. Because different components of the Earth system change at different rates and are relevant at different timescales, Earth system history is a diverse and complex science. Students of Earth system history are not just concerned with documenting what has happened; they also view the past as a series of experiments in which solar radiation, ocean currents, continental configurations, atmospheric chemistry, and other important features have varied. These experiments provide opportunities to learn the relative influences of and interactions between various components of the Earth system. Studies of Earth system history also specify the full array of states the system has experienced in the past and those the system is capable of experiencing in the future. </p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUndoubtedly, people have always been aware of climatic variation at the relatively short timescales of seasons, years, and decades. Biblical scripture and other early documents refer to droughts, floods, periods of severe cold, and other climatic events. Nevertheless, a full appreciation of the nature and magnitude of climatic change did not come about until the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a time when the widespread recognition of the deep antiquity of Earth occurred. Naturalists of this time, including Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, Swiss-born naturalist and geologist Louis Agassiz, English naturalist Charles Darwin, American botanist Asa Gray, and Welsh naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, came to recognize geologic and biogeographic evidence that made sense only in the light of past climates radically different from those prevailing today.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGeologists and paleontologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries uncovered evidence of massive climatic changes taking place before the Pleistocene—that is, before some 2.6 million years ago. For example, red beds indicated aridity in regions that are now humid (e.g., England and New England), whereas fossils of coal-swamp plants and reef corals indicated that tropical climates once occurred at present-day high latitudes in both Europe and North America. Since the late 20th century the development of advanced technologies for dating rocks, together with geochemical techniques and other analytical tools, have revolutionized the understanding of early Earth system history.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe occurrence of multiple epochs in recent Earth history during which continental glaciers, developed at high latitudes, penetrated into northern Europe and eastern North America was recognized by scientists by the late 19th century. Scottish geologist James Croll proposed that recurring variations in orbital eccentricity (the deviation of Earth’s orbit from a perfectly circular path) were responsible for alternating glacial and interglacial periods. Croll’s controversial idea was taken up by Serbian mathematician and astronomer Milutin Milankovitch in the early 20th century. Milankovitch proposed that the mechanism that brought about periods of glaciation was driven by cyclic changes in eccentricity as well as two other orbital parameters: precession (a change in the directional focus of Earth’s axis of rotation) and axial tilt (a change in the inclination of Earth’s axis with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun). Orbital variation is now recognized as an important driver of climatic variation throughout Earth’s history (see below Orbital [Milankovitch] variations).</p>

        <h2>Causes of climate change</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbspIt is much easier to document the evidence of climate variability and past climate change than it is to determine their underlying mechanisms. Climate is influenced by a multitude of factors that operate at timescales ranging from hours to hundreds of millions of years. Many of the causes of climate change are external to the Earth system. Others are part of the Earth system but external to the atmosphere. Still others involve interactions between the atmosphere and other components of the Earth system and are collectively described as feedbacks within the Earth system. Feedbacks are among the most recently discovered and challenging causal factors to study. Nevertheless, these factors are increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in climate variation. The most important mechanisms are described in this section.</p>
        <h3><I>1] Solar variability:</I></h3>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe luminosity, or brightness, of the Sun has been increasing steadily since its formation. This phenomenon is important to Earth’s climate, because the Sun provides the energy to drive atmospheric circulation and constitutes the input for Earth’s heat budget. Low solar luminosity during Precambrian time underlies the faint young Sun paradox, described in the section Climates of early Earth.</P>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRadiative energy from the Sun is variable at very small timescales, owing to solar storms and other disturbances, but variations in solar activity, particularly the frequency of sunspots, are also documented at decadal to millennial timescales and probably occur at longer timescales as well. The “Maunder minimum,” a period of drastically reduced sunspot activity between 1645 and 1715, has been suggested as a contributing factor to the Little Ice Age.</P>

        <h3><I>2] Greenhouses Gases:</I></h3>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space. </p>
        <h3><I>Four Major Gases That Contribute to the Greenhouse Effect:</I></h3>
        <h4>Carbon Dioxide:</h4>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Human activities have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% since the Industrial Revolution began (1750). This sharp rise in CO2 is the most important climate change driver over the last century.</p>
        <h4>Methane:</h4>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane. As a single molecule, methane is a far more effective greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide but is much less common in the atmosphere. The amount of methane in our atmosphere has more than doubled since pre-industrial times.</p>
        <h4>Nitrous Oxide:</h4>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years. </P>
        <h4>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</h4>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature – they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray-can propellants. An international agreement, known as the Montreal Protocol, now regulates CFCs because they damage the ozone layer. Despite this, emissions of some types of CFCs spiked for about five years due to violations of the international agreement. Once members of the agreement called for immediate action and better enforcement, emissions dropped sharply starting in 2018.</p>
        <h4>Water Vapor:</h4>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Rather, as other forcings (like carbon dioxide) change global temperatures, water vapor in the atmosphere responds, amplifying climate change already in motion. Water vapor increases as Earth's climate warms. Clouds and precipitation (rain or snow) also respond to temperature changes and can be important feedback mechanisms as well.</p>
        <h3><I>Human Activity Is the Cause of Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations:</I></h3>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.</p>
        <h3><I>3] Volcanic activity:</I></h3>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspVolcanic activity can influence climate in a number of ways at different timescales. Individual volcanic eruptions can release large quantities of sulfur dioxide and other aerosols into the stratosphere, reducing atmospheric transparency and thus the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface and troposphere. A recent example is the 1991 eruption in the Philippines of Mount Pinatubo, which had measurable influences on atmospheric circulation and heat budgets. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the island of Sumbawa had more dramatic consequences, as the spring and summer of the following year (1816, known as “the year without a summer”) were unusually cold over much of the world. New England and Europe experienced snowfalls and frosts throughout the summer of 1816.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspVolcanoes and related phenomena, such as ocean rifting and subduction, release carbon dioxide into both the oceans and the atmosphere. Emissions are low; even a massive volcanic eruption such as Mount Pinatubo releases only a fraction of the carbon dioxide emitted by fossil-fuel combustion in a year. At geologic timescales, however, release of this greenhouse gas can have important effects. Variations in carbon dioxide release by volcanoes and ocean rifts over millions of years can alter the chemistry of the atmosphere. Such changeability in carbon dioxide concentrations probably accounts for much of the climatic variation that has taken place during the Phanerozoic Eon. </p>

       <h3><I>4] Tectonic activity:</I></h3>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTectonic movements of Earth’s crust have had profound effects on climate at timescales of millions to tens of millions of years. These movements have changed the shape, size, position, and elevation of the continental masses as well as the bathymetry of the oceans. Topographic and bathymetric changes in turn have had strong effects on the circulation of both the atmosphere and the oceans. For example, the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the Cenozoic Era affected atmospheric circulation patterns, creating the South Asian monsoon and influencing climate over much of the rest of Asia and neighbouring regions.</P>
        <p>Tectonic activity also influences atmospheric chemistry, particularly carbon dioxide concentrations. Carbon dioxide is emitted from volcanoes and vents in rift zones and subduction zones. Variations in the rate of spreading in rift zones and the degree of volcanic activity near plate margins have influenced atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout Earth’s history. Even the chemical weathering of rock constitutes an important sink for carbon dioxide. (A carbon sink is any process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the chemical conversion of CO2 to organic or inorganic carbon compounds.) Carbonic acid, formed from carbon dioxide and water, is a reactant in dissolution of silicates and other minerals. Weathering rates are related to the mass, elevation, and exposure of bedrock. Tectonic uplift can increase all these factors and thus lead to increased weathering and carbon dioxide absorption. For example, the chemical weathering of the rising Tibetan Plateau may have played an important role in depleting the atmosphere of carbon dioxide during a global cooling period in the late Cenozoic Era. </p>

        <h3><I>4] Orbital (Milankovich) variations:</I></h3>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe orbital geometry of Earth is affected in predictable ways by the gravitational influences of other planets in the solar system. Three primary features of Earth’s orbit are affected, each in a cyclic, or regularly recurring, manner. First, the shape of Earth’s orbit around the Sun, varies from nearly circular to elliptical (eccentric), with periodicities of 100,000 and 413,000 years. Second, the tilt of Earth’s axis with respect to the Sun, which is primarily responsible for Earth’s seasonal climates, varies between 22.1° and 24.5° from the plane of Earth’s rotation around the Sun. This variation occurs on a cycle of 41,000 years. In general, the greater the tilt, the greater the solar radiation received by hemispheres in summer and the less received in winter. The third cyclic change to Earth’s orbital geometry results from two combined phenomena: (1) Earth’s axis of rotation wobbles, changing the direction of the axis with respect to the Sun, and (2) the orientation of Earth’s orbital ellipse rotates slowly. These two processes create a 26,000-year cycle, called precession of the equinoxes, in which the position of Earth at the equinoxes and solstices changes. Today Earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) near the December solstice, whereas 9,000 years ago perihelion occurred near the June solstice.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThese orbital variations cause changes in the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of solar radiation, which in turn drive a number of climate variations. Orbital variations play major roles in pacing glacial-interglacial and monsoonal patterns. Their influences have been identified in climatic changes over much of the Phanerozoic. For example, cyclothems—which are interbedded marine, fluvial, and coal beds characteristic of the Pennsylvanian Subperiod (323.2 million to 298.9 million years ago)—appear to represent Milankovitch-driven changes in mean sea level.</p>
