         <h2> Environment & Climate change</h2>
         <h4> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A liveable planet for every child</h4>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA safe, clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is essential to the full enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, including the rights to health, food, water and sanitation. Climate change threatens the enjoyment of these rights. States have an obligation to prevent the foreseeable adverse effects of climate change. They also have an obligation to ensure that those affected by it, particularly those in vulnerable situations, have access to remedies and means of adaptation to enjoy lives of human dignity.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspVirtually every child on the planet is already affected by climate change. Natural disasters, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss can devastate agriculture, cutting children off from nutritious foods and safe water. They can lead to dangerous environments and disease outbreaks, and destroy the safe shelter, quality health care and education systems children need to survive and thrive.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs humanitarian action falls short of addressing the climate crisis, children and young people are bearing the brunt. They make up half of the world’s population, but are least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and other hazardous practices harming our environment.</p>
        <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe climate crisis is changing children. It is robbing them of their ability to grow healthy and happy, and can ultimately cause illness, disease and even death. Efforts to sustain a liveable planet must not only account for the unique needs and vulnerabilities of young people; they must also include them in the solutions. Children and young people have critical skills, experiences and ideas for safer, more sustainable societies. They are not simply inheritors of our inaction — they are living the consequences today. </P>
