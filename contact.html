        <h2>WELCOM TO LOTUS</h2>
        <p>A safe, clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is essential to the full enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, including the rights to health, food, water and sanitation. Climate change threatens the enjoyment of these rights. States have an obligation to prevent the foreseeable adverse effects of climate change. They also have an obligation to ensure that those affected by it, particularly those in vulnerable situations, have access to remedies and means of adaptation to enjoy lives of human dignity.</p>
